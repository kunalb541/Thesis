# Dataset Status Report

## âœ… Completed Datasets

### Distinct (100k events)
```
File: data/raw/distinct_100k_final.npz
Size: ~280 MB
Events: 50k PSPL + 50k Binary
Parameters: Caustic-crossing only (uâ‚€ < 0.15)
Cadence: 20% missing
Error: 0.10 mag
Standardized: Yes
Shuffled: Yes
Masking verified: Yes
Status: âœ… READY FOR TRAINING
Expected accuracy: 98%+
Purpose: Validate model architecture works
```

### Baseline (1M events)
```
File: data/raw/baseline_1M_final.npz
Size: ~2.8 GB
Events: 500k PSPL + 500k Binary  
Parameters: Wide range (realistic population, uâ‚€ âˆˆ [0.001, 1.0])
Cadence: 20% missing
Error: 0.10 mag
Standardized: Yes
Shuffled: Yes
Masking verified: Yes
Status: âœ… READY FOR TRAINING
Expected accuracy: 65-75%
Purpose: Realistic performance assessment
```

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes Applied
- [x] Masking bug fixed (USE_SHARED_MASK=False now works)
- [x] Standardization verified (mean=0, std=1)
- [x] Shuffling verified (classes mixed)
- [x] PAD_VALUE handling correct

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Training Checklist
- [x] Distinct dataset generated and processed
- [x] Baseline dataset generated and processed
- [x] Masking verified for both datasets
- [x] Data shuffling verified
- [x] All test files cleaned up
- [ ] GPU access secured
- [ ] Training scripts ready
- [ ] Monitoring scripts ready

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. Wait for GPU allocation
2. Train on distinct first (validate model)
3. If distinct reaches 98%+, train on baseline
4. Evaluate both with early detection
5. Compare results
