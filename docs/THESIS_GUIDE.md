# Complete Thesis Workflow Guide

**Goal**: Systematically benchmark binary vs PSPL classification performance under different observational conditions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Questions

Your thesis will quantitatively answer:

1. **What's the best achievable performance?**  
   â†’ Test with ideal conditions (dense cadence, low error, easy binaries)

2. **How does observing cadence affect classification?**  
   â†’ Test 5%, 20%, 30%, 40% missing observations

3. **How early can we reliably detect binary events?**  
   â†’ Test classification with partial light curves (33%, 50%, 67%)

4. **What's the physical detection limit?**  
   â†’ Test easy vs hard binary topologies (caustic-crossing vs PSPL-like)
