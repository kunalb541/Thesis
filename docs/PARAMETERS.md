# Binary Parameters and Physical Interpretation

Understanding which binary parameters make events **distinguishable from PSPL** is critical for interpreting your thesis results.

## 🔑 Key Insight: The u₀ Parameter

**u₀ (impact parameter)** is the **most important** parameter for distinguishability.

### What is u₀?

The impact parameter is the minimum distance between the source trajectory and the center of mass of the lens system, measured in Einstein radii.

```
        Source trajectory
              →
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                         ↑ u₀
          • ←───────────┘
        Lens
```

### Why u₀ Matters

**Small u₀ (< 0.1)**: Source passes **close** to the lens
- High magnification
- **Crosses caustics** (critical curves where magnification → ∞)
- Sharp, distinctive spikes in the light curve
- **Easy to distinguish from PSPL**

**Large u₀ (> 0.3)**: Source passes **far** from the lens
- Moderate magnification
- **Misses caustics**
- Smooth, PSPL-like light curve
- **Hard to distinguish from PSPL**

### The Detection Threshold

**Physical interpretation**: ~15-20% of binary events have u₀ > 0.3 and fundamentally look like PSPL events. This is a **fundamental limit** - no amount of better observing or better algorithms can fix this!

Your thesis quantifies: **For the remaining 80-85% of events with u₀ < 0.3, how well can we detect them under realistic conditions?**

## 📐 Binary Parameters Explained

### Core Binary Parameters

#### 1. **s (separation)**
- **Definition**: Distance between the two masses in Einstein radii
- **Range**: 0.3 - 2.0 (standard), 0.8 - 1.2 (easy), 0.1 - 0.3 (hard)
- **Physical meaning**: 
  - s < 1: Close binary → caustics merge into single structure
  - s ≈ 1: Wide binary → large central caustic + two planetary caustics
  - s > 1: Very wide binary → caustics well separated

**Why it matters**: s ≈ 1 produces the largest caustics, making crossings more likely!

```
s = 0.5 (close)       s = 1.0 (wide)        s = 2.0 (very wide)
      
  ⚫─⚫                  ⚫     ⚫                ⚫           ⚫
   │ │                  │     │                │           │
  caustics            caustics              caustics
   merged              large                 small
```

#### 2. **q (mass ratio)**
- **Definition**: Ratio of secondary to primary mass (m₂/m₁)
- **Range**: 0.1 - 1.0 (standard and easy), 0.5 - 1.0 (hard)
- **Physical meaning**:
  - q ≪ 1: Planetary system (tiny companion)
  - q ≈ 1: Equal mass binary (symmetric)

**Why it matters**: 
- Low q → asymmetric caustics → more distinctive features
- High q → symmetric caustics → can mimic PSPL symmetry

#### 3. **u₀ (impact parameter)**
- **Definition**: Minimum distance to lens center (Einstein radii)
- **Range**: 0.01 - 0.5 (standard), 0.001 - 0.1 (easy), 0.3 - 0.5 (hard)
- **Physical meaning**: How close the source passes to the lens

**THIS IS THE KEY PARAMETER!**

**Impact on observability**:
```
u₀ = 0.05:  ████████████  (crosses caustic, clear spike)
u₀ = 0.20:  ██████░░░░░░  (might graze caustic)
u₀ = 0.40:  ███░░░░░░░░░  (misses caustic, looks like PSPL)
```

#### 4. **ρ (source size)**
- **Definition**: Angular size of the source (Einstein radii)
- **Range**: 0.001 - 0.05 (standard), 0.0001 - 0.01 (easy), 0.03 - 0.1 (hard)
- **Physical meaning**: Finite source size "smooths out" sharp caustic crossings

**Why it matters**:
- Small ρ → sharp spikes during caustic crossing → distinctive
- Large ρ → smoothed features → harder to detect
- Finite source effects dominate for timescales < ρ × tE

```
Point source (ρ→0):    Finite source (ρ=0.01):    Large source (ρ=0.05):
        
    ^                      ^                          ^

    │╱  ╲                  │ ╱   ╲                    │ ╱    ╲

   Sharp spike          Smoothed spike             Very smooth
```

#### 5. **α (source trajectory angle)**
- **Definition**: Angle of source trajectory relative to binary axis
- **Range**: 0 - π (all configurations)
- **Physical meaning**: Determines which caustics the source might cross

**Why it matters**: 
- Some angles lead to central caustic crossing
- Other angles lead to planetary caustic crossing
- Affects the shape and timing of features

#### 6. **tE (Einstein crossing time)**
- **Definition**: Time for source to cross one Einstein radius
- **Range**: 10 - 150 days (PSPL), 10 - 100 days (Binary)
- **Physical meaning**: Event timescale, depends on lens mass and relative motion

**Why it matters**: 
- Short tE → rapid evolution → need dense cadence to resolve
- Long tE → slow evolution → easier to observe but survey duration matters

## 🔬 Physical Interpretation for Your Thesis

### Key Findings to Discuss

1. **The u₀ threshold**: ~15-20% of binary events have u₀ > 0.3 and are fundamentally PSPL-like. This is a **hard physical limit**.

2. **The s≈1 sweet spot**: Wide binaries (s ≈ 0.8-1.2) have the largest caustics and are easiest to detect.

3. **Source size matters**: Finite source effects (ρ) become important for ρ > 0.01. This sets a resolution limit for detecting rapid caustic crossings.

4. **Asymmetry helps**: Low mass ratio (q < 0.5) creates asymmetric caustics that are more distinctive than symmetric ones.

### Implications for LSST and Roman

**LSST** (ground-based, wide field):
- Typical photometric error: σ ≈ 0.1-0.15 mag
- Cadence: ~3-4 days → misses ~20-30% of observations
- **Conclusion**: Will detect most easy events (u₀ < 0.1) but struggle with moderate cases (0.1 < u₀ < 0.3)

**Roman Space Telescope** (space-based, narrow field):
- Typical photometric error: σ ≈ 0.01 mag (10× better!)
- Cadence: 15 min → dense, continuous coverage
- **Conclusion**: Should detect nearly all caustic-crossing events, limited only by fundamental u₀ threshold

### Your Contribution

By systematically benchmarking performance across parameter space, you provide **quantitative guidance** for:
- Survey design (how dense should cadence be?)
- Follow-up triggers (when to activate 8-10m telescopes?)
- Realistic event rates (what fraction of binaries will we actually detect?)

## 💡 Quick Reference

**To make a binary event easy to detect:**
- ✓ Small u₀ (< 0.1) - crosses caustics
- ✓ s ≈ 1 - largest caustics
- ✓ Small ρ (< 0.01) - sharp features
- ✓ Low q (< 0.5) - asymmetric
- ✓ Dense cadence - don't miss spikes
- ✓ Low photometric error - see small features

**Fundamental limits:**
- ✗ u₀ > 0.3: Will look like PSPL regardless of other parameters
- ✗ Large ρ (> 0.05): Smooths out all caustic features
- ✗ Extreme s (< 0.3 or > 2): Tiny caustics, low crossing probability

**Remember**: Even perfect observations and perfect algorithms can't overcome the u₀ > 0.3 fundamental limit. About 15-20% of binary events are intrinsically indistinguishable from PSPL. Your thesis quantifies the performance on the remaining 80-85%!
