### Binary Parameters and Physical Interpretation

Understanding which binary parameters make events **distinguishable from PSPL** is critical for interpreting your results.

## 🔑 Key Physical Principles

### The Caustic Crossing Phenomenon

**Caustics** are critical curves in the lens plane where magnification theoretically approaches infinity. When a source star crosses a caustic, the light curve shows:
- Sharp, dramatic spikes
- Complex, multi-peaked structure
- Features that PSPL events cannot produce

**This is the key signature for detecting binary lenses.**

## 📐 Binary Parameters Explained

### 1. **u₀ (Impact Parameter)** - THE MOST IMPORTANT

**Definition**: Minimum distance between source trajectory and lens center of mass (in Einstein radii)

```
        Source trajectory
              →
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                         ↑ u₀
          ● ●           ┘
        Binary lens
```

**Physical significance**:
- **Small u₀ (< 0.15)**: Source passes close to lens
  - High probability of crossing caustics
  - Strong, distinctive features
  - Clearly different from PSPL
  
- **Medium u₀ (0.15 - 0.30)**: Moderate distance
  - May or may not cross caustics (depends on s, q)
  - Moderate magnification
  - Sometimes distinguishable, sometimes not
  
- **Large u₀ (> 0.30)**: Source passes far from lens
  - Very low caustic crossing probability
  - Weak magnification
  - **Fundamentally PSPL-like**
  - No algorithm can reliably distinguish these

**Research finding**: Approximately 15-25% of binary events have large u₀ and are intrinsically indistinguishable from PSPL. This is a **fundamental physical limit**, not a machine learning limitation.

### 2. **s (Separation)** - Caustic Size Controller

**Definition**: Distance between the two lens masses (in Einstein radii)

**Physical significance**:
- **s < 0.5**: Close binary
  - Caustics merge into single structure
  - Smaller overall caustic size
  
- **s ≈ 0.8-1.5**: Wide binary
  - **Largest caustics** (maximum cross-section)
  - Highest detection probability
  - Clear central caustic + planetary caustics
  
- **s > 2.0**: Very wide binary
  - Caustics become small and separated
  - Lower detection probability

```
s = 0.3           s = 1.0           s = 3.0
(close)           (wide)         (very wide)

  ●─●              ●     ●          ●           ●
  tiny            LARGE            small
caustics         caustics        caustics
```

**Optimal for detection**: s ≈ 0.8-1.5 (wide binary regime)

---

### 3. **q (Mass Ratio)** - Asymmetry Parameter

**Definition**: Ratio of secondary to primary mass (m₂/m₁)

**Physical significance**:
- **q << 1 (e.g., 0.001)**: Planetary system
  - Jupiter/Sun ≈ 0.001
  - Earth/Sun ≈ 0.000003
  - Asymmetric caustic structure
  - Smaller planetary caustics
  
- **q ≈ 0.1-0.5**: Intermediate
  - Brown dwarfs, low-mass stars
  - Moderate asymmetry
  
- **q ≈ 0.5-1.0**: Stellar binary
  - Equal or near-equal mass
  - More symmetric caustics
  - Can mimic PSPL symmetry if u₀ is large

```
q = 0.001         q = 0.1           q = 1.0
(planet)        (brown dwarf)     (equal mass)

●―――――●          ●――――●            ●―●
big   tiny      big  small      symmetric
```

**For detection**: Lower q (more asymmetric) generally produces more distinctive features, **but only if u₀ is small enough to cross caustics**.

### 4. **ρ (Source Size)** - Feature Sharpness

**Definition**: Angular radius of the source star (in Einstein radii)

**Physical significance**:
- **ρ << 0.01**: Point-like source
  - Infinitely sharp caustic crossing spikes
  - Maximum feature contrast
  
- **ρ ≈ 0.01-0.03**: Typical source
  - Caustic features smoothed but visible
  - Realistic for most observations
  
- **ρ > 0.05**: Large source
  - Heavily smoothed caustic crossings
  - Features may be undetectable
  - "Finite source effects" dominate

```
Light curve during caustic crossing:

ρ → 0             ρ = 0.01          ρ = 0.05
(point)           (typical)         (large)

    ∧                 ∧                 ∧
   ╱ ╲              ╱   ╲             ╱     ╲
  ╱   ╲            ╱     ╲           ╱       ╲
 ╱     ╲          ╱       ╲         ╱         ╲
──────────     ─────────────    ───────────────
Sharp spike     Rounded peak      Smooth bump
```

**Detection requirement**: ρ < 0.03 for clear caustic signature

---

### 5. **α (Trajectory Angle)** - Caustic Encounter Geometry

**Definition**: Angle between source trajectory and binary axis

**Physical significance**:
- Different angles → different caustic encounters
- Some angles lead to central caustic crossing
- Other angles lead to planetary caustic crossing
- Averaged over all angles in realistic populations

**Less critical** than u₀, s, q for overall distinguishability.

---

### 6. **tE (Einstein Crossing Time)** - Event Timescale

**Definition**: Time for source to cross one Einstein radius

**Physical significance**:
- **tE ~ 10-50 days**: Typical for bulge events
- **tE ~ 50-200 days**: Long events (good for detailed study)
- **tE < 10 days**: Rapid events (need dense cadence)

**Detection impact**:
- Longer tE → more observations → better characterization
- Shorter tE + sparse cadence → may miss caustic crossing

## 🎯 Parameter Sets in This Project

### BASELINE (Wide Range)
**Goal**: Represent realistic population from planetary to stellar

```python
{
    's': (0.1, 10.0),      # All separations
    'q': (0.001, 1.0),     # Planetary to equal-mass
    'u₀': (0.001, 1.0),    # All impact parameters
    'ρ': (0.0001, 0.1),    # All source sizes
    'tE': (10, 200),       # All timescales
}
```

**What to expect**: Mixed population
- Some events clearly binary (small u₀, good geometry)
- Some events clearly PSPL-like (large u₀)
- Performance depends on the u₀ distribution

---

### DISTINCT (Maximum Distinguishability)
**Goal**: Events guaranteed to look different from PSPL

```python
{
    's': (0.8, 1.5),       # Wide binary (largest caustics)
    'q': (0.01, 0.5),      # Asymmetric
    'u₀': (0.001, 0.15),   # MUST cross caustics
    'ρ': (0.0001, 0.01),   # Sharp features
    'tE': (20, 150),       # Good timescale
}
```

**What to expect**: Near-perfect classification possible
- All events cross caustics
- Clear, sharp features
- Only limited by observational effects (cadence, noise)

---

### PLANETARY (Planet Detection)
**Goal**: Simulate planetary microlensing events

```python
{
    's': (0.5, 3.0),       # Typical planet orbits
    'q': (0.0001, 0.01),   # Jupiter-mass to super-Jupiter
    'u₀': (0.001, 0.5),    # All impacts
    'ρ': (0.0001, 0.05),   
    'tE': (10, 150),       
}
```

**Physical context**:
- Models planet-hosting systems
- Planetary caustics are smaller than central caustic
- Detection depends critically on u₀ and s

---

### STELLAR (Binary Stars)
**Goal**: Simulate stellar binary lenses

```python
{
    's': (0.3, 5.0),       # Stellar separations
    'q': (0.3, 1.0),       # Near-equal to equal mass
    'u₀': (0.001, 0.8),    # All impacts
    'ρ': (0.001, 0.1),     
    'tE': (20, 200),       # Often longer than planetary
}
```

**Physical context**:
- Models binary star systems
- More symmetric caustics (higher q)
- May be harder to distinguish if u₀ is large

---

**Key insight**: Both planetary and stellar binaries become indistinguishable from PSPL at large u₀. The mass ratio matters less than the geometry.
